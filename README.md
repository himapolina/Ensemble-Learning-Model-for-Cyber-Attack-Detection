# Ensemble-Learning-Model-for-Cyber-Attack-Detection
A training dataset is preprocessed by feature mapping, replacing missing values with mean of that particular feature, correlation coefficient method to identify optimized features and feature normalization. Then we implement 10 cross fold validation to train three ML algorithms (i.s Decision tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest. The prediction outputs obtained are used to build a predictive model. If the incoming traffic showcases any malicious behavior the system administrator will be alerted and otherwise the request made will receive a response.
